  # Public: configuration options.
  # Currently, you can set:
  # - endpoint: (URL) through which the Batch API will be exposed (default
  # "/batch)
  # - verb: through which it's accessed (default "POST")
  # - limit: how many requests can be processed in a single request
  # (default 50)
  # - decode_json_responses: automatically decode JSON response bodies,
  # so they don't get double-decoded (e.g. when you decode the batch
  # response, the bodies are already objects).
  #
  # There are also two middleware-related options -- check out middleware.rb
  # for more information.
  # - global_middleware: any middlewares to use round the entire batch request
  # (such as authentication, etc.)
  # - per_op_middleware: any middlewares to run around each individual request
  # (adding headers, decoding JSON, etc.)
