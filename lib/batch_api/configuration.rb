  # - endpoint: (URL) through which the Batch API will be exposed (default
  # "/batch)
  # - verb: through which it's accessed (default "POST")
  # - limit: how many requests can be processed in a single request
  # (default 50)
 #
  # There are also two middleware-related options -- check out middleware.rb
  # for more information.
  # - global_middleware: any middlewares to use round the entire batch request
  # (such as authentication, etc.)
  # - per_op_middleware: any middlewares to run around each individual request
  # (adding headers, decoding JSON, etc.)
